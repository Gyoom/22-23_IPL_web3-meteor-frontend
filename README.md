To install and use this project:

1. Prerequisites and useful information :

    - If you are on a Mac M1 (Arm64 version) you need to have Rosetta 2 installed, as Meteor uses it for running MongoDB. Check how to install it here

    - Meteor works with Node.js version >= 10 and <= 14, for Windows you need to have Node.js installed for running the npm         installer (tip: you can use nvm for managing node versions).

    - Meteor supports Windows 7/Windows Server 2008 R2 and up.

    - Disabling antivirus (Windows Defender, etc.) will improve performance.

    - For compatibility, Linux binaries are built with CentOS 6.4 i386/amd64.

    - iOS development requires the latest Xcode.

    - Do not install meteor npm in your projectâ€™s package.json by any means, the npm library is only an installer.
